The final code is contained within the folder "Final code". 

The first code file, "01_Dataset_Pickling.ipynb", shows how we pickled our dataset. 

The second code file, "02_Similarity_MAP.ipynb", shows how we pre-processed and processed our dataset. It also shows our implementation of similarity metrics to find the most relevant documents and has the code for generating MAP scores for the solution based on the test set.

To run "01_Dataset_Pickling.ipynb", you will need the following files:

"jd.list" - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y2nZ80VT2AVodf9GaahOsXSwmFqtw96l/view?usp=sharing

"resume.list" = https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GT_XyXksuqLbnRmjH-IZYB9Mmc8nOXE2/view?usp=sharing

Before running "01_Dataset_Pickling.ipynb", ensure that "JD_FILES_PATH" and "RESUME_FILES_PATH" are updated to reflect their directory in your system. Also, ensure that "JD_FILES_PICKLE_OUTPATH" and "RESUME_FILES_PICKLE_OUTPATH" are in satisfactory directories.

To run "02_Similarity_MAP.ipynb", you will use the pickled files obtained from the code above. Alternatively, you may download and use the following files:

"jds.pickle" - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KmKPV5qPvzJt1oosZP4z2AVQHZAEC7T6/view?usp=sharing

"resumes.pickle" - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H6VbAo1myUCTGtsPuNbQeQEtZxpJ7Cgx/view?usp=sharing

Before running "02_Similarity_MAP.ipynb", ensure that "JD_FILES_PICKLE_OUTPATH" and "RESUME_FILES_PICKLE_OUTPATH" point to either the pickle files obtained from running the first code, or the pickle files downloaded through the drive links.
